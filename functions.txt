Method 1 : Otsu Thresholding (cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
------------------------------------------------------

- Using simple thresholding we needed to manually supply a threshold value of T. However ,Otsu’s thresholding attempt to be more dynamic 
and automatically compute the optimal threshold value based on the input image.

- Otsu’s method assumes that our image contains two classes of pixels: the background and the foreground.

- It makes the assumption that the grayscale histogram of our pixel intensities of our image is bi-modal, 
which simply means that the histogram is two peaks: 

   1- the first sharp peak corresponds to the uniform background color of the image.
   2-the second peak corresponds to the pill region itself.


Method 2 : Truncate Thresholding ( THRESH_TRUNC )
----------------------------------------------------------
- In this type of thresholding:

   . If pixel intensity value is greater than threshold, it is set to the threshold. 
   . The pixel values are set to be the same as the threshold. 
   . All other values remain the same.
   .The maxValue is ignored

For example : If the threshold is set to 100  :-
-------------
    1- All values above 100 are set to 100.
     2-All values less than or equal to 100 are unchanged
